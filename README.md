# 📄 Smart Text Editor

A Java-based desktop text editor that showcases the power of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) — featuring undo/redo, auto-suggestions, edit history navigation, and file operations, all crafted with pure Java. This project is perfect for learners who want to apply DSA concepts in a real-world application.

## 🔍 What Makes It Stand Out?

✅ Pure DSA Approach: No external libraries, no fancy frameworks — just core Java and well-crafted data structures.

✅ Educational Focus: Ideal for students or developers learning how to apply stacks, tries, and linked lists in real applications.

✅ Extendable Base: You can easily enhance it with syntax highlighting, spell check, multi-tab support, or export options.

✅ Cross-Platform: Runs anywhere Java runs.
